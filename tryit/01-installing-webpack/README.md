In this exercize we create a new NPM project and then install Webpack as a development dependency.

You could install Webpack globally.  I have found that installing Webpack globally works well and is reliable.  I personally prefer installing Webpack on a project by project basis because it's a nice way to document the version of Webpack your project is using in the package file.

It also makes sense to install Webpack as a dev dependency because it's only used as build time.

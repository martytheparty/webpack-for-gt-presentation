# Installing webpack

## First create an NPM project with the following command line command:

    npm init -y

*note: The -y tells NPM to build your project with defaults.*

## Second add webpack as a dev dependency with the following command line command:

    npm install webpack --save-dev

*note: The --save tells NPM to create an entry in the packages file.  The -dev tells NPM to create the entry as a development specific library.*

commands:
npm init -y
npm install webpack --save-dev

  "description": "When Web Applications are delivered to browsers via HTTP the JavaScript files are transported across multiple (sometimes dozens) layers.  Every layer is a good opportunity for caching.  Caching is absolutely necessary for the Internet to operate.  Adding a hash code to the name of JavaScript files is a sure fire way to make sure changed files name breaks that cache at every layer.  An example of a hashed file name model.3ke3k3lek.js where 3ke3k3lek is a hash code calculated based on the contents of the file.  If the contents change the code changes.",

Webpack Presentation For The GaTech WebDev Club Feb. 6th 2018

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler.

The following issues are often faced by professional webdev developers.

1. Not loading changed files because of caching
2. Reloading unchanged/cached files because of blind cache busting
3. Excessive network connections
4. Dead JavaScript code loaded
5. Code is executed before supporting functionality/resources have been loaded
6. Namespace collisions
7. Third party code manipulating state/functionality
8. Conflicting versions of code needed in the same application
